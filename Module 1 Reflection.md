Overall, this first module was a useful refresher for some basic physical computing and electronics principles. I do have some background using Arduino and Processing, so in full honesty, I wasn’t expecting to learn too much inn the first few weeks. To my surprise, I did learn more about the theoretical groundwork micro controllers and different electronic parts (like the 555 timer) than I expected. It was a good refresher and helped conceptualize some of the things we made and solidify the mechanisms that were being used. 

That said, I wish we did a little more hands-on activities in class. While I understand the important of theoretical knowledge, I would rather have the outlines in class with references for extra readings for those who are interested and spend more time actually problem solving or playing with different electronic parts to see what they do, how we can use them, etc. It’s easier to find a description of Ohm’s Law online than suggestions/examples/advice for creative solutions using electronics or Arduino specifically. There is definitely a sea information, but I feel like exposure to and narrowing into specific interesting or impactful projects and maybe tinkering with some of the components used in those projects is the advantage of taking this course within an MFA program as opposed to an electrical engineering program.

Apart from that, I also wish we had more time to work more with Arduino, specially using Arduino as input for Processing etc.  But overall, I’m glad we went over basic electronics first, introducing Arduino only after we got a solid understanding of some of the fundamental concepts.
